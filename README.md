# AsteroCat

AsteroCat is a basket of solar-like oscillators. There are currently dozens of papers that list detections in various forms, using different methods and from different instruments, but to my knowledge there is no central repository that consolidates them all. This is an attempt at starting this iniative.

The focus is on listing which stars have no, partial, or firm detections. It is not for listing all the physical characteristics and various model parameters of the stars. As such we will only list some simple characteristics related to the detection itself, such as $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Delta \nu$.
